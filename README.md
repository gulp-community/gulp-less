## Installation

```
npm install gulp-less
```

## Basic Usage

```js
var less = require('gulp-less');
var path = require('path');

gulp.task('less', function () {
  return gulp.src('./less/**/*.less')
    .pipe(less({
      paths: [ path.join(__dirname, 'less', 'includes') ]
    }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./public/css'));
});
```

## Options

The options you can use [can be found here](http://lesscss.org/#using-less-configuration). Below is a list of valid options as of the time of writing:

- `paths`: Array of paths to be used for `@import` directives
- `plugins`: Array of less plugins ([details](#using-plugins))

The `filename` option is not necessary, it's handled automatically by this plugin. The `compress` option is not supported -- if you are trying to minify your css, use a css minifier. No `sourceMap` options are supported -- if you are trying to generate sourcemaps, use [gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps).

## Using Plugins

Less now supports plugins, which can add additional functionality. Here's an example of how to use a plugin with `gulp-less`.

```js
var LessAutoprefix = require('less-plugin-autoprefix');
var autoprefix = new LessAutoprefix({ browsers: ['last 2 versions'] });

return gulp.src('./less/**/*.less')
  .pipe(less({
    plugins: [autoprefix]
  }))
  .pipe(gulp.dest('./public/css'));
```

More info on LESS plugins can be found at http://lesscss.org/usage/#plugins, including a current list of all available plugins.

## Source Maps

`gulp-less` can be used in tandem with [gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps) to generate source maps for your files. You will need to initialize [gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps) prior to running the gulp-less compiler and write the source maps after, as such:

```js
var sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');

gulp.src('./less/**/*.less')
  .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
  .pipe(less())
  .pipe(sourcemaps.write())
  .pipe(gulp.dest('./public/css'));
```

By default, [gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps) writes the source maps inline in the compiled CSS files. To write them to a separate file, specify a relative file path in the `sourcemaps.write()` function, as such:

```js
var sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');

gulp.src('./less/**/*.less')
  .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
  .pipe(less())
  .pipe(sourcemaps.write('./maps'))
  .pipe(gulp.dest('./public/css'));
```

## Error Handling

By default, a gulp task will fail and all streams will halt when an error happens. To change this behavior check out the error handling documentation [here](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/recipes/combining-streams-to-handle-errors.md)
