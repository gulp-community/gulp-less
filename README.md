gulp-less
=========

A LESS plugin for Gulp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/plus3network/gulp-less.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/plus3network/gulp-less)

## Install

```
npm install gulp-less
```

## Usage
```javascript
var less = require('gulp-less');
var path = require('path');

gulp.task('less', function () {
  gulp.src('./less/**/*.less')
    .pipe(less({
      paths: [ path.join(__dirname, 'less', 'includes') ]
    }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./public/css'));
});
```

## Options

The options are the same as what's supported by the less parser. Please note that this plugin only generates inline sourcemaps (with `sourceMap: true`) - specifying a `sourceMapFilename` option will do nothing.

You can use ```modifyVars``` option to override some vars.
```javascript
//...
.pipe(less({modifyVars:{myVar:'10px'}}))
//...
```

## Error handling

By default, a gulp task will fail and all streams will halt when an error happens. To change this behavior check out the error handling documentation [here](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/recipes/combining-streams-to-handle-errors.md)
